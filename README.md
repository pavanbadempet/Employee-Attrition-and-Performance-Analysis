# Employee-Attrition-and-Performance-Analysis

## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop analytics and insights that would optimize employee
performance and control attrition

## Introduction

In today's fast-paced business environment, organizations face a significant challenge of retaining
their employees. Employee Attrition, which refers to the loss of employees over time, is a critical issue
that can have a significant impact on an organization's productivity, profitability, and overall success.
To ensure optimal employee productivity and quality of delivery, it is essential to have an effective
employee performance management system in place.
With the advent of Data Science and analytics, organizations can now leverage their vast amounts of
data to gain insights into employee attrition and take corrective action.
In this context, this background highlights the importance of employee performance management
and the role of Data Science and analytics in analyzing relevant datasets to gain insights into
employee attrition.

## Approach

1. Analyzed dataset and identified driving factors related to analytics.
2. Designed graphs and charts using Power BI based on the factors identified.
3. Designed dynamic dashboard

The workflow involved in analyzing the dataset and identifying driving factors related to analytics
consists of several stages. The first stage involves a comprehensive analysis of the dataset to identify
the relevant factors that contribute to employee attrition. Once the driving factors are identified, the
next stage involves designing graphs and charts using Power BI, which enables visualization of the
data to gain a better understanding of the trends and patterns. Finally, the dashboard is designed
dynamically to provide real-time insights into the driving factors that contribute to employee
attrition. This workflow enables organizations to gain insights into the factors that influence employee
attrition and take corrective action to optimize employee productivity and retention.

## Enhancement Scope

There are enormous ways to enhance the scope of this project,

1. One area for enhancement could be the integration of machine learning models to predict future
   employee attrition based on historical data. This would enable organizations to take proactive
   measures to address potential attrition and retain valuable employees.
2. Another area for enhancement could be the inclusion of interactive features in the dashboard,
   such as filters or drill-down capabilities, to provide users with a more detailed and customized
   view of the data. This would allow users to analyze the data in a more granular manner and make
   more informed decisions.
